Swift is a relatively new programming language introduced by Apple but developed by an open source community. It has largely replaced Objective-C for developing apps for Apple OSes.

> Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS. Writing Swift code is interactive and fun, the syntax is concise yet expressive, and Swift includes modern features developers love. Swift code is safe by design and produces software that runs lightning-fast.
