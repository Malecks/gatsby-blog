### Proposed Solution
- **Organized Dashboards**: Reorganized dashboards by in-app features for intuitive navigation, allowing program managers to gain insights into specific program areas quickly.

- **Focused Pages**: Limited dashboards to 6 charts or tables per page to reduce load times and cognitive load, enhancing usability.

- **Progressive Hierarchy**: Introduced a natural hierarchy for insights, emphasizing general performance and content stats, while enabling exploration of more complex data.

- **Accessible Exports**: Provided upfront access to data tables for exporting, catering to unique or one-time analysis requests.
