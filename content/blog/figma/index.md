I spend ~80% of my time as a designer working in Figma! It has quickly become the industry standard tool for interface design, with powerful features for collaboration, supporting design systems, and prototyping.

> Figma is an end-to-end design platform, here to help teams understand problems, explore options, and build solutions—together.
