Prototyping Tools

> Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS. Writing Swift code is interactive and fun, the syntax is concise yet expressive, and Swift includes modern features developers love. Swift code is safe by design and produces software that runs lightning-fast.

#### [Origami](https://origamistudio.com) Use patches to define powerful interactions and animations. Developed by Facebook.

#### Pros
* Easily the most powerful prototyping tool on this list
* Can take advantage of hardware capabilities (Camera, keyboard, accelerometer etc.)
* Finite control over animations
* Can manage state, not just linear flows
* Closely mimicks how you might accomplish a similar output in code

#### Cons
* Steep learning curve
* Requires an app to preview
* No collaboration tools
* Creating and sharing libraries of components is clunky

#### [Figma](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/index.html) Prototype directly in the standard design tool.
#### Pros
* Your designs are the prototype; no need to keep two files and import designs
* Quick to set up linear flows
* Magic transitions and overlays can take you pretty far
* Plays nicely with your component libraries
* Easy to share and collaborate with your team

#### Cons
* Any prototype that is sufficiently complex will become messy quickly
* Cannot manage state without duplicating artboards and creating messy flows
*
