### [Origami](https://origamistudio.com)
> Use patches to define powerful interactions and animations. Developed by Facebook.

##### Pros
* Easily the most powerful prototyping tool on this list
* Can take advantage of hardware capabilities (Camera, keyboard, accelerometer etc.)
* Finite control over animations
* Can manage state, not just linear flows
* Closely mimicks how you might accomplish a similar output in code

##### Cons
* Steep learning curve
* Requires an app to preview
* No collaboration tools
* Creating and sharing libraries of components is clunky

### [Figma](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/index.html)
> Prototype directly in the standard design tool.

##### Pros
* Your designs are the prototype; no need to keep two files and import designs
* Quick to set up linear flows
* Magic transitions and overlays can take you pretty far
* Plays nicely with your component libraries
* Easy to share and collaborate with your team

##### Cons
* Any prototype that is sufficiently complex will become messy quickly
* Although managing state has recently gotten better with the introduction of variables, file-speed quickly slows down, and it's not particularly intuitive.
