When it comes to product design, Design Systems are a way of creating shared elements that provide a consistent foundation for designers working on the same product (or multiple products that use the same design language).

Many modern design systems are built with Brad Frost's atomic design in mind.

> A lot has been said about creating design systems... establishing foundations for color, typography, grids, texture and the like. This type of thinking is certainly important, but... I’ve been more interested in what our interfaces are comprised of and how we can construct design systems in a more methodical way.
