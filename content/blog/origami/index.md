Origami is my favourite tool for producing high-fidelity prototypes for mobile design. It does a great job of easily mimicking native behaviours and animations. But it's super-power is in the ability to manage state, and take advantage of hardware capabilities like keyboards and the camera.

> Tap into native hardware APIs. Expand the potential of your prototypes with patches that unlock hardware capabilities.
