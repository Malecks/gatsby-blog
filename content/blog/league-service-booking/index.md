> Designing a health care service booking feature at League

In April 2021, I undertook a project with League to design a 'Service Booking' feature in collaboration with Loblaw Companies Ltd., Maple, and Lifemark. The goal was to enable users to seamlessly book various health services offered by Maple and Lifemark through the PC Health mobile app.
